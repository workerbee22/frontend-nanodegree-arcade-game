## Playing the Game

Move your character around the grid using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Your goal is to reach the river at the top. Once you do this you have won and your character will return to it's starting position so you can play again.

But enemy bugs are moving across the screen at different speeds and are out to get your character. If your character collides with an enemy bug your character will return to it's starting position so you can play again.

You can use the following keys to play the game:

- **up** arrow key - Move character UP
- **down** arrow key - Move character DOWN
- **left** arrow key - Move character LEFT
- **right** arrow key - Move character RIGHT

Special keys you can use:

- **c** key - to change your character at any time
